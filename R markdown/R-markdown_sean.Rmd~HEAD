abstract: "Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum."

# Introduction
The House Pricing Prediction app is created for estimate the house price for both buyer and seller based on different factors such as total Sqft, house locations, etc. The deployment was constructed using ShinyApp. An user friendly app for both buyer and seller, with simple click of factors users will get an estimated housing price. The app can be used for individual buyers who want to know the final price of the houses they are interested or for individual sellers to know what is the best listing price. The app uses regression model for prediction, which was trained by the data set of Toronto housing price. The housing price is strongly correlated with other factors, for increasing the model accuracy decreasing errors, it is important to try different factors and combinations. This project will comprehensively validate four different models: decision tree, random forest, K nearest neighbors, and gradient boosting machine. This report will go through data analysis, modeling implementation and provide an optimistic result for housing price prediction. 


## Objective
The objective of this project was to evaluate the application of machine learning algorithms to predict house prices in the Greater Toronto Area, and apply 

## Background
Purchasing a house if a big life decision for every individual and needs a considerable amount of research. Everyone has different purpose of buying houses, someone would prefer by the house at the best rate for living now, someone would buy houses for future investment. Selling the houses is also very important and needs to do research and decide what is the best leasing price. Commonly, people will ask advise from various websites, real estate agents or realtors before purchasing or leasing; However, due to the trend towards big data, house pricing prediction can be done by using machine learning strategies base on large amount of data from previous years more correctly. House Price Index (HPI) can measure the price changes of residential housing as a percentage change, In Canada the new Housing Price Index is calculated monthly by Statistics Canada. HPI is useful but because it is a rough indicator calculated from all transactions, it is inefficient for predicting a specific house with its attributes. The purpose of this project is to create an app for both buyers and sellers can easily check the predicted list price or final price based on the attributes of the house such as locations, square foot, number of bedrooms, etc.  

# Methodology
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Data Preprocessing
The dataset was originally gathered from Zoocasa API.
